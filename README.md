# Rate my cat

## Goal

The goal of this interview is to develop an angular SPA based on this API that will allow users to rate cats. The application should allow users to:

- Add a cat, with a name, a breed and a birthday.
- See a list of cats, with their average score and:
  - order them by either their name, their breed, or their average score.
  - filter them by their breed or their average score.
  - search them by their name.
  - the list should be paginated.
- See more details about a cat.
- Update details about a cat if there was a mistake (name, breed or birthday).
- Rate a cat with an optional comment
- See the comments of a cat with their notes.
